# F3D Alpine package builder environment using macOS / QEMU

## Usage

Simply run `make`.

By default that will run an `aarch64` virtual machine and boot you into a console.

To run an x86 VM, run `make x86_64`.

## Building

Once you have a running machine:

1. Follow the [Alpine build environment guide](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Setting_up_the_build_environment_on_HDD)
2. Copy `src/APKBUILD` into your Alpine VM
3. Execute `abuild -r`.
4. Copy the built packages out of the VM for publishing.
